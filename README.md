# AsapUnityBridge

As presented [during the IVA 2017 conference in Stockholm](http://iva2017.org/).


## Getting Started

Clone this repository with git. Then enter the directory and fetch submodules:

```git clone https://github.com/hmi-utwente/AsapUnityBridge.git```
```cd AsapUnityBridge```
```git submodule update --init --recursive```


### Configuring the Unity Project
With Unity (tested with version 2017.1), open the folder AsapUnityBridge/UnityExampleSetup. 
There is one dependecy, UMA (tested with version 2.6.1) that needs to be downloaded from the [asset store here](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/35611) and imported to the Unity project.

You can open the example scene: UnityAsapIntegration/ExampleScenes/AsapExampleUMA

Running this scene doesn't do much. The agent animation is driven by ASAP.

### Configuring ASAP
